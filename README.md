# OpenCV Recognition

This project is an implementation of OpenCV-based image recognition for object detection and face recognition. The goal is to create a simple, easy-to-use library for developers to use in their projects.

# Dependencies

To use this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3
OpenCV
Numpy
Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can run the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

To use this project, you can simply import the object_detection and face_recognition modules and use their respective functions.

For object detection:

python
Copy code
from object_detection import detect_object
import cv2

image = cv2.imread('test_image.jpg')
detected_image = detect_object(image)
cv2.imshow('Object Detection', detected_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
For face recognition:

python
Copy code
from face_recognition import recognize_faces
import cv2

image = cv2.imread('test_image.jpg')
recognized_image = recognize_faces(image)
cv2.imshow('Face Recognition', recognized_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
